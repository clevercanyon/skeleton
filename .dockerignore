# Customizations.
#
# Please do not attempt to inject exceptions by customizing your projectâ€™s `./.dockerignore` file
# in ways that loosen our standard defaults. We have tooling in place that will conflict with your efforts.
# For example, `vite-plugin-c10n-post-process` will automatically prune files from a resulting `./dist`
# built with our tooling. The pruning that it does strictly adheres to our default `./.dockerignore` rules,
# and intentionally does not factor in your customizations.
