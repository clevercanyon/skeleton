# Dev-Only Files

### **`./dev`** is a container for files used only in project development phase.

- `./dev` ... houses optional `./dev/.env` files and `./dev/.files` at the top level of a project.
    - `**/dev/**` is ignored by `.npmignore` everywhere, e.g., at top level, or deeper within.

See: [Reserved Filesystem Names](https://github.com/clevercanyon/canyon/blob/main/docs/skeleton/dev/.files/system/fs-reserved-names.md) for further details.
