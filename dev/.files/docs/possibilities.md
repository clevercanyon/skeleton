## `appType` + `targetEnv` Possibilities

## Default Skeleton

- clevercanyon/skeleton (`custom` + `any`)
- â†‘ clevercanyon/skeleton-dev-deps (dev dependencies)

## All Possible Combinations

Our build system supports `appType` on `targetEnv` directives. However, not all combinations
actually make sense. For example, one would never create a `multipage` app and target a
`web-worker` environment. The same with `multipage` on `any`, because a multipage app needs to
target something that will serve it as HTML. Likewise, creating a `custom` on `cf-pages` app makes
no sense. Instead, we'd create a `multipage` on `cf-pages` app.
