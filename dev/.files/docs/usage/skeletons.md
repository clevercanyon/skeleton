# Skeleton Project Templates

To start a new project with one of our skeletons, simply run:

```bash
$ cd ~/Projects/clevercanyon
$ npx degit clevercanyon/skeleton my-new-project --mode=git
```

-   Change `clevercanyon/skeleton` to [any other skeleton project](https://github.com/orgs/clevercanyon/repositories?q=skeleton) you'd like to start from.
-   Change `my-new-project` to the directory you'd like your new project to live in.

```bash
$ cd ~/Projects/clevercanyon/my-new-project
```
